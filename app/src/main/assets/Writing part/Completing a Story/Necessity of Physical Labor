  var title = "Necessity of Physical Labor";
  var text = `Once there was an idle king. He did not like physical labor. As a result he grew bulky and could not move from one place to another. Finding no other way he called in a doctor. The doctor was very clever and wise. He prescribed no medicine for the king. He asked the king to buy a club and move it in the air till his hands got moistened. The king followed the advice of the physician. In consequence of this the fat grew less. He became a bit thin. Finally he became fully cured of his disease after some dayâ€™s regular physical exercise.`;
