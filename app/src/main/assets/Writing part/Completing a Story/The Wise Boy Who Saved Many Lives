  var title = "The Wise Boy Who Saved Many Lives";
  var text = `Mabrur was a dutiful boy studied in a village school. He went to school everyday and learned his lessons well. His school was four kilometers away from his house. Everyday he walked to school.  The road was along a railway line.
<br>

One night there was a storm. There was a great damage for it. The railway line was damaged. The boy came near the railway line and realized that many people would die for it. 

<br>
At that moment he heard the sound of a train. Soon he hit upon a plan. He put off his shirt which was red in colour and waved it like a flag in order to draw the attention of the driver and the guard. Fortunately the trail stopped. Mabrurâ€™s wise plan saved hundreds of passengers. All the people in the train thanked Mabrur for his wise plan to stop the train. They remained over grateful to the village boy.`;
