  var text = `${men[0]} is a worker in a big garment factory. More than five thousand workers work in that factory. One
day while he was busy in work a sound was heard, “Fire! Fire! Help! Help”. As ill news runs apace,
the news spread very fast among the workers. Naturally all the workers got into a panic. They
started to run at a time towards the gate of the garments factory. There was only one gate to come
out of the factory and only one stair to come down to the gate. So while all the workers were trying to
come out of the factory using the only stair, some workers fell down. ${men[1]} was one of them. They
were trodden down by other workers. At least ten workers were severely injured and
two faced death. But fortunately ${men[1]}'s injury was not fatal. It was irony of the
fate that there was actually no fire. In fact, a naughty young worker out of jest cried out saying “fire,
fire”. The other workers took it true and started to come out of the factory resulting in a tragic
accident.`;
