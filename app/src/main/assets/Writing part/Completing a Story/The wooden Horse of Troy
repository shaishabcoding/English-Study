Some best soldiers were put into the body of the horse. The Greeks left the war field leaving the wooden horse. The Trojans came out of the four walls of the city, saw the horse and took it into the city. While the Trojans were in deep sleep at night, the soldiers came out of the body of the horse and opened the gate of the city. The waiting Greek soldiers entered the city and attacked the Trojans.
