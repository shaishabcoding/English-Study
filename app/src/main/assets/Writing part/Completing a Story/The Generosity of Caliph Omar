On hearing the fact, his wife expressed her eagerness to help the woman. Then they set out. They took some food with them. After a while, they reached the house of the woman. The Beduin woman was walking restlessly. The Caliph gave her food. She was glad to have a meal. She expressed her feelings towards them. She told that the Caliph Omar was a harsh man. Later on, she learned that the visitor was the Caliph himself.
