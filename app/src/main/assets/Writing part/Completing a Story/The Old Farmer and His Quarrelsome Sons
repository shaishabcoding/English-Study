  var title = "The Old Farmer and His Quarrelsome Sons";
  var text = `There lived an old farmer in a certain village. He had four sons who were very quarrelsome. That is why he was too worried about them because they may go to any extent after his death. One day, he was too sick and was lying on his deathbed. He called all of his sons. When they came, he told them to bring a bundle of sticks. They did so. Then, he asked each of them to take the bundle and break it. They tried but failed. Then, he asked one of them to untie the bundle and break each stick. The sticks got broken easily. He requested his sons to remain united like the bundle of sticks, or else anyone can harm them easily. They learnt the value of unity.
