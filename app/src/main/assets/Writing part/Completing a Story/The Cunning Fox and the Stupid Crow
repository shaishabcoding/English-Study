  var text = `One day, a hungry fox was wandering in search of food. It hadn’t eaten anything since the past three days. Suddenly, it caught sight of a crow with  piece of bread/meat in its beak. It wished to have the piece of bread/meat. It hit upon a plan. It praised the crow saying that it had a sweet voice. It persuaded the crow to sing a song. As soon as the crow opened its beak to sing, the piece of bread/meat fell down on the ground. The fox took/picked it up and went/walked away merrily.<br><br><b>Moral</b> ᐅ Never believe a stranger fully.`;
