Dear Shaishab, <br>
I want you to know that you are appreciated. I never got to thank you enough for everything you have done for me.
<br>
You always find a way to make sure I feel loved, wanted and needed. After all these years, I am confident that our love has grown stronger than before.
<br>
My only hope is that we remain steadfast and won't forget to depend on each other for strength and more love.

<br><br>
Sincerely,
<br>

Sila
