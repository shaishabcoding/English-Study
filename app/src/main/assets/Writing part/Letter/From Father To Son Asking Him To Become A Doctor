 Dear Nadeem,<br>
Your mother got operated yesterday. She is now better improving gradually. I hope you would be enjoying the of your health. <br>
During my few minutes’ meeting with the doctor yesterday, I felt the necessity and importance of a doctor’s services to mankind. Besides, it’s a very respectable and paying profession too. I wish, Azeem, you could as well become a doctor one day. How proud I would be of you! Your sister is taking care of your mother in the hospital. Sara remembers you very much.
<br><br>
Yours sincerely,`;
