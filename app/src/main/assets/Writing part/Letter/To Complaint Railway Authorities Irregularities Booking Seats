Dear Sir, <br>
I take this Opportunity to draw your attention to the irregularities committed by the booking stall at cantt. Railway Station, Chittagong. <br>
A few days ago, I reached the booking office before 8 AM and stood in the queue for getting a seat booked for Peshawar. We waited till ten, when the window opened and a man was seen sitting in front of it. After a while he left his seat and was gone to take tea. After three quarters or so of an hour, he returned to his seat and started hooking. <br>
When my turn came he informed me that no seat was available for the next fifteen days. He further advised me to come at 4 PM and if any scat was cancelled he would give the same to me. I was again informed in the evening that no seat was available. <br>
As I was coming out of the verandah, a porter approached me and offered his services for getting the seat booked. Since I was in urgent need of the scat paid him 20% more than the fare and I got the scat booked.
I hope you would look into the matter and take steps to prevent this malpractice in future.
<br><br>
Yours faithfully,`;
