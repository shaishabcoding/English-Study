Dear Mr. Shahnawaz,<br>
I am really very sorry to have to write this letter to you. I am sure, however, that you will not misunderstand me. You have always been a kind and considerate neighbor to us. <br>
I am busy preparing myself for the coming annual examination. The high sound of your radio set up to the late hours of night disturbs me. I cannot concentrate on my books. Perhaps, you are not aware of the unusual loudness of your set. I should be greatly obliged if you tone down your set in such a way that you may easily listen to it and at the same time leave me to read in peace. <br>
With kind regards.
<br><br>
Yours faithfully,`;
