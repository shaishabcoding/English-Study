<p id="ques">To Editor Of A Newspaper Complaining About Increasing Use Of Narcotics In The Youth</p><br><br><br>
<p>Wrold Trade Centre,<br>
Chittagong.<br>
20 January 2023<br>
The Editor,<br>
The Daily Nation,<br>
Chittagong.
<br><br>
Dear Sir,<br>
It is a sad fact that more and more young people are indulging in narcotics these days. Not only students are using narcotics but children are also using them. Young men even children are seen smoking outside their homes. It is an alarming sign. These young people might lose their health and suffer from chronic diseases.
<br>
The government should introduce heavy penalties and severe punishment for those people who are selling these narcotics to people especially the youth. If our youth is addicted to narcotics, our nation can never make progress.<br>
The concerned authorities should look into the matter and take serious action in this connection.<br><br>
Yours truly,<br>
Shaishab Chandra Shil</p>
