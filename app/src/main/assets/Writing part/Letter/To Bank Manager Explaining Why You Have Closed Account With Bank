Dear Sir,<br>
Re : Closure of my PLS Account No.912 <br>
While acknowledging receipt of your letter dated 6.7.94 enclosing there with a demand draft of Rs.62401-beiflg the amount of my balance outstanding at the close of business on 6.7.94, 1 have to advise that the service rendered by your bank is wonderfully excellent and prompt. The treatment cooperation and reverence I received from your staff is exemplary. I have not closed my account for any grievance but the reason for it is that we are shifting to a village in Punjab where we have acquired a farm. <br>
I once again thank you and your staff for the cooperation extended to me.
<br><br>
Yours faithfully,`;
