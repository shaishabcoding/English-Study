My Dear Father,<br>
Many thanks for your kind letter which I received sometimes back. I was very much please to read it. My result was declared one week ago. You will be glad to know that I have come out successful. I have stood third in my class. I am now in class X in which news books have been prescribed. These are very costly and I have to buy them all. As classes will start from the next month I would need some money immediately for the purchase of books. Kindly, therefore send Rs.1000/- by money order as soon as possible. So that I may buy these articles without delay.<br>
Please convey my compliments to all the members of the family and love to Mummy.<br>
With best wishes.<br><br>

Your Loving Son,`;
