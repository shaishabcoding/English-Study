Yours letter of the 5th instant is to hand. You have wanted to know about what I want to do after the S.S.C examination is over.
<br>
Our examination will come to an end of the 2nd April. I have decided to make proper use of the days till the publication of results. I have thought out a plan to help the mass people of our village to better their conditions. I shall spend the whole period working hand in hand with them. I shall start a night school to teach the 3 R, s to the illiterate adult people. I shall discuss with them about ways and means to make. "Grow more food" campaign a success. Moreover, I shall talk with them about the rules of health and sanitation hoping to hear from you soon. With best wishes
