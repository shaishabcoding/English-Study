Thank you very much for your kind letter. I was so much shocked to read it that I cannot express my feelings in words. I am very sorry to know that your grandmother died in an accident. I offer my heartiest sympathy to you at her untimely death.<br>
I hope that you will send me an early reply. Please convey my compliments to the friends and love to dear Nadim.
With best wishes,`;
