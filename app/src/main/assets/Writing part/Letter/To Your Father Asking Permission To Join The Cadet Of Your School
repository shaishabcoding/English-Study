I am keeping well. The atmosphere in the new school is good. Lessons have begun and I am studying them well.
Next week they are selecting pupils for Cadet of our school. I am eager to join the Cadet and get military training. They will give a certificate at the end of two years. It will be very useful in future. I am sure the Cadet classes will in no way affect my studies.
I request you to give me permission to join the Cadet.`;
