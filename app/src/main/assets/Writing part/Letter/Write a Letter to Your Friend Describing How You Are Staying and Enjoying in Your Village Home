I am glad to hear that you are enjoying yourself in a tea garden of Sylhet. I am here in our village to which your letter was redirected. I was reluctant to come here, but having done so I feel very happy. Born and brought up in Dhaka as I was, I had never known this village where my father and grandfather had lived. It is such a change for me that I have already liked the place so much and taken decision to spend the rest of the time before the publication of our result here in this village.
<br>
The air is fresh here. Here are lots of fresh vegetables that we can eat. My grandmother takes a keen interest in cooking and making cakes. There is a well kept pond beside our house. My cousins take me for a dip everyday and I am trying to learn swimming. The local high school is not far from here and the school has a library. I am getting lots of books to read. Write soon as you can. Best luck.
