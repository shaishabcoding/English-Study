Sir,<br>
Through the column of your esteemed paper, I want to draw the attention of the higher officials of the education department and the parents to the grave problems of smoking among students. Smoking in its different forms, has become a favorite hobby of most of the students. The number of such students is increasing day by day. Now ever the young students studying in primary and high schools are taking to this hazardous habit. Girls, too, are not exception,. At first students adopt this habit as fashion after getting allured by the t.v commercials. Later on they get addicted to it. Everybody knows that smoking is injurious to health. Smokers suffer from such fatal diseases as cancer, t.v and heart attack. It is also the sheer waste of money. Students spend their parent’s hard earned money on these damaging habit.
<br>
It is the duty of the parents to keep a vigilant eye on their children’s and sees in whose company they spend their time. Teachers should also realize their duty. They should themselves avoid smoking before the students. Special lectures to explain the devastating effects of smoking are arranged regularly. No teacher or student should bane allowed to smoke in the college premises.

<br>
I hope that both teachers and parents will take some drastic measures to check this trend among the students.

<br><br>
Yours truly,<br>
Shaishab Chandra Shil
