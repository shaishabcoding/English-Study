Dear Nasreen,<br>
Every time I go to bed, you're the last thing on my mind. I keep telling myself just how lucky I am to be your man.
<br><br>
I say to myself over and over that I will take care of your precious heart. I've worked so hard just to win your love, and there's no way I'm going to screw things up.
<br><br>

Sincerely,`;
