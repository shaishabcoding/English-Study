<p id="ques">To The Editor Of A Newspaper Complaining About The Law And Order Situation In Your City</p><br><br><br>
<p>Nail Centre,<br>
Chittagong.<br>
20 January 2023<br>
The Editor,<br>
The Daily Nation,<br>
Chittagong.
<br><br>
Dear Sir,<br>
The city district government has developed Chittagong by making roads and parks in the whole city.
However, it is a pity that they start digging the roads over a wide area all at once. The roads become unusable. It causes great inconvenience to people.
The city government should make a wise plan for the city. The making of new roads and the breaking of old roads should be systematic. This is not a wise strategy to leave a vast area in a dilapidated condition for a long time. Sometimes it takes years to build roads.
The concerned authorities should look into the matter and save people from the inconvenience.
<br><br>
Yours truly,<br>
Shaishab Chandra Shil
