<p id="ques">Love Letters to Wife<p> <br><br>
<p>My charming wife,

<br><br>
I send you much love and fondness to you with this letter. My adorable wife, how far can you go for me? I am keen to go far and beyond just to let you realize that you are the most excellent thing that has happened to me!
<br><br>

Sweetheart, your love is deeper than the deepest ocean, extensive than the skies and brighter than the brightest star that shines all night.

<br><br>
My loving wife , you raise my soul every time I think of you. You are my sunrise and the shining star!

<br><br>
Love</p>
