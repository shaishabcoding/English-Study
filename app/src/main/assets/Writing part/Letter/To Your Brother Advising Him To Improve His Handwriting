I received your letter yesterday. The hand writing is not legible. It took me twenty minutes to make out the contents of your letter.<br>
I would advise you to improve your hand-writing. Then only you can score high marks. Write two pages in a copy writing note book daily. I must see definite improvement in hand writing in your next letter.`;
