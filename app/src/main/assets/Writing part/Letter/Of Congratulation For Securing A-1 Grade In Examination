While over whelming with joy on hearing of your brilliant success in the S.S.C examination, I congratulate you on securing A-1 grade. Diligent, hard working and studious as you are, I expected you to pass your examining on with flying colors. Proud as I am of you. I expect you to achieve more and more success in life.<br>
As a token of my joy, I am sending a small present of the full set of the dramas of Shaw.
With love.
<br><br>
Yours affectionately,`;
