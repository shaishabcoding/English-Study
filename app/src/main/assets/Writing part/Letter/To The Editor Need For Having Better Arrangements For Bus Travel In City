Sir,<br>
Travelling by bus in the city is easier now, but not entirely comfortable. The buses are almost always overloaded. I make these suggestions. <br>
i. There should be a larger number of buses. <br>
ii. Buses should run on the time. <br>
iii. There should be more comfortable seats for passengers in the buses. <br>
iv. Defective busses should be repaired soon. In no case should buses with old (worm out) engines and tyres be allowed to run. <br>
I hope that the bus companies and the government will act on these suggestions.
<br><br>
Yours truly,`;
