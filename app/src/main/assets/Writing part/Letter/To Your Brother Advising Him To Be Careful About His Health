I am very glad to know that you have got high marks in the Exams. I am informed that you were over absorbed in your studies and do not care for your health. It is not good.<br>
Dear brother, you should know that only a sound body has a sound mind. Try to sleep early. Go outside for a morning walk. You should have light exercises in the morning also. If you keep on reading without taking any exercise, your health will soon break down. I think you will give proper attention to my advises. I am waiting for a good report from you.
With best wishes,`;
