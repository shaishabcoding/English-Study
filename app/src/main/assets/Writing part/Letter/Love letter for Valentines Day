Dear Nasreen,<br>
On this Valentine's Day, let me remind you that I won't wait every February to show you just how much you mean to me.
<br>
I would just like you to know that I've set up a little date for us at [location]. I'll pick you up later at 7 p.m.
<br>
What's waiting for you is a surprise.
<br><br>

Sincerely,`;
