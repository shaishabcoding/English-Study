Dear Nasreen, <br>
We haven't been together for so long, but I already feel that you are the girl who makes me genuinely happy.
<br>
I feel comfortable and secure with you, it's like I have nothing to worry about.
<br>
Know that I am yours, and I will stay faithful to you--that's my promise.
<br><br>

Sincerely,`;
