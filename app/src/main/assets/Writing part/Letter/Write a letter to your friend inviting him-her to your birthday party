At the beginning of the letter, take my cordial love. Hope that you are well by the grace of all mighty Allah. I am also well by the grace of Allah. You will be glad to know that I am going to be a girl/boy of twelve on Monday next. My parents will arrange a birthday party for this purpose. I invite you to join my birthday party. Please come with your younger brother. This is all for today. Best wishes to you and all.
<br>
No more today. More when we shall meet you.`;
