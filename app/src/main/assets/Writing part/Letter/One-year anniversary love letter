Dear Nasreen,<br>
Today is a special day for the both of us, and I can't wait to spend the whole day with you.
<br>
Happy one year anniversary, my love. I just want you to know that I appreciate the patience and unselfishness you have shown since the day that we got together.
<br>
You have shown to me how lucky I am to have you in my life.
<br>
I love you even more today, and I am sure that my feelings for you will stay for the rest of my life.
<br><br>

Sincerely,`;
