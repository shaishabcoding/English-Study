Dear Sir,<br>
Through the column of your esteemed paper, I want to draw the attention of the higher authorities to the bane of beggary that is fast creating problems in the busy streets and markets of our city. All public places, roads and markets are thronged with different type of beggars. They include young and old men and women, small boys and girls, blind and lame. At every traffic signal they rushed towards the cars and try to fleece money using different tactics from the passengers. They distract the attention of there drivers and thus cause accidents. Some of the beggars are so horribly mutilated and diseased that children get scared to see them. It has a negative effect on their psyche. Most of these beggars are criminals. Beggar women and children sneak in the crowded places and steal peopleâ€™s purse, mobiles and other valuables.<br>
Islam discourages begging. It is the duty of the state to provide basic necessities of life to its citizens. It should take immediate measures to rehabilitees old and handicapped beggars provide jobs to the young boys and girls and send small children to school.
<br><br>
Yours truly,<br>
