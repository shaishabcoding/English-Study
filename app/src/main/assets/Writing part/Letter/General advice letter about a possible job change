<p id="ques">General advice letter about a possible job change</p> <br><br><br>

Dear Shaishab, <br>

I have thought through your dilemma about that possible job change. I have to say my advice would be to stay in your current position at Clifton's. You are one of the few people I know of who is truly happy in their work. You need to decide whether Carlton's is going to make you as happy in your job.
<br>
Going to Carlton's will require relocation, creating an upheaval for your wife and children. You would have to find new schools and new friends. I can see a lot of negatives and very few positives from moving position. The ultimate decision though is yours and requires a lot of thought on your behalf. I wish you well in whatever you decide, and let me know what your final decision is. If there is any other help or guidance I can give, please let me know.
<br><br>

Sincerely,

<br>
Jamal hossain
