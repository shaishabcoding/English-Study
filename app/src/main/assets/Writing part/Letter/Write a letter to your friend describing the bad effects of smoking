At the beginning of the letter, take my cordial love. I am sorry that you have been addicted to smoking.You know that smoking is a bad habit. It does a lot of harm to us. A single puff of cigarette smoke contains 15 billion particles of substances which are very dangerous for health. Smoking causes cancer,heart attack and other fatal diseases. Excessive smoking may lead a person for premature death.
<br>
I would suggest you to give up smoking just now. Firm determination of mind will help you in this respect. Never indulge in such dangerous habit again.`;
