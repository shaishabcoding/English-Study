<p id="ques">Love Letters for Girlfriend<p> <br><br>
<p>Sweetheart,
<br><br>
I wanted to write you a love letter. I know it’s a little silly but I thought I’d try anyway. It’s just that I feel so much when I’m with you that I try to put it in words, so that you know how I feel about you.
<br><br>

I can't see you right now but I can picture how you are. I see your hair and the way it falls on your shoulders, the way you smile and how you look right before you laugh. I want to be next to you right now. I don’t want you to hold anything back.

<br><br>
I can feel you close to me even though you're far away. Please believe me when I say I love you.

<br><br>
Love
