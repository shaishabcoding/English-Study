<p id="ques">To Editor Of A Newspaper Complaining About The Unplanned Road Digging All Over City</p>
<p>Nail Centre,<br>
Dhaka.<br>
20 January 2023<br>
The Editor,<br>

<br><br>
Dear Sir,<br>
The law and order situation is quite unsatisfactory in our city. Everybody is worried about the lawlessness. Mobile snatching, car lifting, robberies, theft and other illegal activities are increasing.<br>
People do not feel safe anywhere. The law and order situation is worsening in the city. If the present situation persists, it is going to be the most dangerous city in the world. Nobody feels safe here especially outside the home. Everybody is worried about the increasing lawlessness in the city.<br>
The police are not doing their duties to check all these illegal activities. The concerned authorities should look into the matter and try to improve the law and order situation.
<br><br>

Yours truly,<br>
Shaishab Chandra Shil</p>
