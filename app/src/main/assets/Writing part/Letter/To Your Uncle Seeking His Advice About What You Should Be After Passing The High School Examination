  var body = `My Dear Uncle,<br><br>
I have done well in the High School Examination. I hope to get more than 75 marks.<br>
My father is of the view that I should learn type writing and short hand and go in for a job. But I feel I am too young to take up a job. So I wish to take up plus-two course and then degree course in a college.
I request you to kindly give your valuable advice in this matter and guide me.`;
