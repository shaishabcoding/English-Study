<p id="ques">Write A Letter To Your Father Informing Him Of Your Performance In The Last Examination</p>
<br><br><br>
<p>My dear father,<br>
Hope this will find everyone at home in good health. The result of the 1st Unit Test has just been out. I have secured 70% marks in the grand total with highest marks in English and Bengali. But I have got very poor marks in Mathematics. You know very well that I am weak in Math. However, I am trying my level best to improve my performance in the subject. I hope Iâ€™ll do better in the next Unit Test. I am sending my progress report by post for your signature. I am well and I am getting on well with my studies. No more now.
<br>
My heart-felt love to you and mother.
<br><br>
Yours affectionately,<br>
Shaishab Chandra Shil</p></body>
