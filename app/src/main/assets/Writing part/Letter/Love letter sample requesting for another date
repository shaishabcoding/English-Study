Who knew that laser tag could be so much fun! I certainly didn't until you took me there during our date the other day. I must admit that I was a little tentative when you told me that we were heading there first before drinks. No one has ever brought me to something like that on a date before. But after a few rounds, I was so happy that you did! I totally appreciate your effort and confidence to break the usual dating tradition. I know that I enjoyed running around the course more than I would have if we just sat down to a regular dinner.
<br>

I think out of all your fantastic traits. I like the fact that you approach the whole dating scene so differently the most. I honestly would not have tried laser tag at all if it hadn't been for you. And if that happened, I wouldn't have been introduced to something so different, yet so enjoyable. I like that you take me places that I've never been before. With you, it's always exciting and every moment is such a breath of fresh air.
<br>

I hope that I get to spend time with you again soon. How about I cook dinner for you this weekend? I remember you saying that you love Italian food, and I hope to satisfy your taste buds by serving you my version of Pasta Alfredo. All my friends love it, and I hope you'll enjoy it too. Let me know if you're available.
<br><br>


Sincerely,`;
