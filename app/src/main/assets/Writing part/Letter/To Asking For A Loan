Constrained by circumstances I approach you with great reluctance to lend me some money. Father has not sent the monthly stipend so far and I have to deposit the Boardâ€™s examination fee immediately. I am sorry to trouble your in this respect and shall be obliged if you arrange to lend me Rupees five hundred by tomorrow. I shall pay your back as soon as money is received from home.`;
