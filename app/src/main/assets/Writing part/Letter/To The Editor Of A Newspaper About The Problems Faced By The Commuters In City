Sir,<br>
Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I would like to arrest the attention of the authorities towards the need for better arrangements for bus travel in ABC City.<br>
The dwellers of ABC City are suffering a lot of problems because of bad arrangements for bus travel. First of all, in the summer season it very difficult to stand in the sun because there are no proper waiting rooms. Secondly, the buses are less than the need of the passengers. People especially women and old people are quite helpless because every bus is squeezed with the passengers and people have to wait for hours to get seats. Thirdly, the behaviour of the conductors is very impolite. Fourthly, the buses do not observe any schedule. Lastly, the condition of the buses is very bad. Buses are often without window glasses and very often break down on the way.<br>
In this regard I would like to make some suggestions. Firstly, passengers should be facilitated with proper waiting rooms. Secondly, the number of buses should be increased. Thirdly, a proper timetable should be followed strictly lest people should not be late. Lastly, the company should take care of the maintenance of the buses properly.<br>
I hope the authorities will take personal interest to improve the situation because the situation is worsening day by day.
<br><br>
Yours faithfully,<br>Shaishab Chandra Shil</p>
