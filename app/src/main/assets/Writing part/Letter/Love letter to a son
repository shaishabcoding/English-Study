Dear Jamal Hossain,<br>
Ten years ago, you were just a baby swaddled in warm blankets depending so much on my presence.
<br>
Now, you can go on for a couple of days without me by your side. I know you're growing up, but I want you to know I'll always be here for you. You'll forever be my little boy.
<br><br>

Sincerely,`;
