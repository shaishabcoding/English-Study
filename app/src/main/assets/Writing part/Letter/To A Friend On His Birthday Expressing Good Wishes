It is your birthday tomorrow, and I am writing to wish you Many Happy Returns of the Day. Mother too sends her love and best wishes on this happy occasion. I should like to give you something to celebrate the event, and I have chosen a photograph album, for I know you are very much interested in photography and I thought this would be useful for your collection of architectural subjects. <br>
Please accept the album with my good wishes and believe inc.

Ever sincerely yours,`;
