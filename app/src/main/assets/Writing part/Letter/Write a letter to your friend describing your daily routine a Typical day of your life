Your letter is just to hand. You have wanted to know about my typical day.
I have a daily routine of my own. Everyday I follow it. I get up at 5:30 to 6:00 am. I walk in the open air for half an hour. I take my bath at 7am.Then I have my breakfast. I start for school at 8:00 am. I returned from school at 1:30 pm. After refreshing I take lunch. Then I rest for an hour. I go to play at 4:00 pm. In the evening I come back home. I wash my face and hands. Then I go to my reading room. I study up to 10:00 pm. Then I take my supper and go to bed.
<br>
No more today., More will be in the next. Write me back your feelings about writing for your reply.Please come to our house as early as possible.
<br>
My best regards to your parents and love to you.`;
