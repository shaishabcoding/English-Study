 <h3><center>Basic Human Rights</center></h3>
 
 <p>Human rights mean the basic needs of human life. Everybody can expect to get these needs as a human being. These needs are essential for the physical, mental, and spiritual development of both men and women. The basic human rights are freedom of speech, security of life, right of citizenship, right to vote, right for education and justice and so on. The children of our country do not get proper rights — right of education, right of medical treatment, right of proper food, etc. The women of our country are being deprived of their rights. They are the victims of gender discrimination. They do not get proper food, clothing, education, freedom of speech, etc. Most of the women are deprived of equal labour benefits because they are not thought to be equal to men in the workforce.
women work longer than men but get less money. Many people cannot enjoy their religious rights. In the world the people are suffering inhumanly. Voting right is not ensured properly in our society. Proper steps should be taken to ensure women's rights. Women have already started working in different fields. They are becoming doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, etc. Women should be properly educated and employed. They should be given power in different spheres of life. They should be made aware of their rights and duties. Their security of life should be ensured at any cost. Seminars and discussion meetings should be organized to highlight the importance of establishing human rights — especially children's rights and women's rights. People should be made conscious of their rights.</p>
