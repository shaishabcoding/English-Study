 <h3><center>The Hakaluki Haor</center></h3>
 
 <p>Bangladesh is covered by different water bodies like beels, canals, haors, and rivers. Hakaluki Haor is considered a major wetland of our country. This is a very complex ecosystem. It contains about 238 beels and waterbodies that are inter-connected with each other. The haor falls under two districts, Maulvibazar and Sylhet. Surrounding the haor, about 190,000 people live. The haor is an important source of different fish in Bangladesh.Fishes like Kalibaus, Boal, Rui, Ghagot, Pabda and Chapila are found here. Beels in the haor provide shelter for many mother fishes in the winter season. Now due to sand deposits, dewatering technique for fishing and lack of aquatic plants, many of those beels have lost their capacity to provide such shelter. The haor is a very important resting place for migratory birds. Unfortunately, illegal poaching has been a threat to the bird population. Hakaluki Haor is good grazing land for cattle in the winter in those areas. The haor system provides economic and non-economic benefits to the people. These benefits include fish and rice production, duck, cattle and buffalo rearing, collection of reeds, grasses, aquatic and other plants. Its unique system adds to the beauty of the landscape both during the monsoon and other seasons. Its beauty and economic importance can attract a large number of tourists.</p>
