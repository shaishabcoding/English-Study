 <h3><center>Independence Day</center></h3>
 
 <p>A long cherished day of ours The Independence Day is a very climacteric event in our national life. On this day the independence of Bangladesh was declared and the people of this country began to march on forward with the aim of achieving independence. The then Pakistani Government ruled over this so-called East Pakistan with an iron hand and they oppressed the people of this country very fiercely. So, discrimination began to develop between the two countries on economical, political, social and religious sides. The people of East Pakistan came to comprehend this discrimination. They protested it at different times. But the government of West Pakistan ignored them and continued their misrule over this country. The main cause for which our nation began war was the refusal of the Pakistani rulers to acknowledge the electoral triumph of the Awami League in December 1970. However, very soon it became obvious to us all that there was an intrigue between the generals who then ruled Pakistan and politicians who were unwilling to see power pass into the hands of the Bengali leadership. For the denial of the results of election, we wanted our liberation. On March 25, 1971 the Pakistani military started genocide which led us to declare our liberation war on 26 March 1971. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared the independence of Bangladesh on this date, just before his arrest by the Pakistani army. On March 27, 1971 Major Ziaur Rahman announced the independence of Bangladesh on behalf of Sheikh Mujib from Kalurghat Radio Station in Chittagong. Afterwards wartime temporary government led the war perfectly. So, the Independence Day is a red-letter day in our history and we celebrate this day with adequate grandeur and spirit of our Bengali identity.</p>
