 <h3><center>Environment Pollution</center></h3>
 
 <p>A cause of health-hazard Nature, air, water, land and all other things around us in which we live are called environment. Any unexpected and abnormal change in chemical, physical and biological characteristics in environment is called the environmental pollution. Now our environment is getting polluted every moment in many ways. In major cities and towns motor vehicles, mills and factories are creating fume and smoke and they pollute air. Man makes fires to cook food, to make bricks, to melt tar for road construction and to do many other things. Fires create smoke and pollute the air. Railway engines and powerhouses create smoke by burning coal and oil and this smoke pollutes the air. Water, another vital element of the environment like air, is also polluted in many ways. Man pollutes water by throwing waste into it. Chemicals, fertilisers and insecticides get mixed with water in rivers, canals and ponds, and thus pollute water. Mills and factories also throw their poisonous chemicals and waste products into rivers, canals and seas and water is polluted. Moreover, water vehicles, unsafe drains and unsanitary latrines are also responsible for water pollution. These days many rivers and lakes are getting filthy. Forests and trees are being cut down on a large scale. So, the ecosystem of the environment is now in great danger. The noise of motor vehicles, mills and factories, aeroplanes, domestic appliances, radios, cassette players, CDs, televisions etc pollutes sound and this polluted sound affects our hearing. The government must take effective steps to prevent the pollution. People of all classes should come forward to control this environmental pollution because it is necessary for our own existence.</p>
