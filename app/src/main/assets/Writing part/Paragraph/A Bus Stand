 <h3><center>A Bus Stand</center></h3>
 
 <p>A bus stand is where buses stop when roads or highways are moving up and down. It is a kind of temporary shelter for travelers. Passengers have to wait for some time to avail themselves of a bus. So, they come and stay for buses on a stand. Usually, it has a shed, a wall, and a concrete bench. There are counters for tickets in Son bus stands, and People are Standing Nobody for Buying Tickets. Sometimes, when someone breaks a line, heated words are exchanged. There are bookstalls or light refreshments. Hawkers with snacks do a little business on a bus stand. Sometimes, seasonal fruits are sold at the bus stand. Passengers refresh themselves while waiting for the bus. However, not all bus stands have shed. People suffer much from the sun's heat or rain in such frames. Most bus stands in Bangladesh do not have sheds. People suffer from the sun's heat or wait for a bus at the risk of uneven rainfall. People do not have to wait long for a bus because there are not enough buses to carry passengers. As a result, passengers have to wait even a few hours at the stand. So, a bus stand should have a shed, a good arrangement for people to sit and have some refreshments.</p>
