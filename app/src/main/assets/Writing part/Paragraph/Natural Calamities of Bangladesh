 <h3><center>Natural Calamities of Bangladesh</center></h3>
 
 <p>An obstacle to progress Bangladesh is called the land of natural calamities. The prime natural disasters of this country are flood, storm, cyclone, drought and famine. Flood visits our country every year due to heavy rainfall. It is the most devastating one of all natural calamities. It takes a serious turn in the monsoon. Due to heavy rain, most of the rivers overflow their banks and thus cause flood. It washes away different types of crops, cattle, homes and properties. The devastating floods in the years of 1988 and 1998 are very remarkable. Most of the districts in the southwest of Bangladesh had been inundated violently. Storm is not less destructive than flood. Storm causes abrupt damage to our life and property. Affected people cannot get the opportunity to save themselves nor their properties. It blows away our homes, trees, cattle and many things. But when a storm revolves violently round a centre, it is called cyclone. It moves at a high speed ranging from forty to more than hundred kilometres per hour. During the last few years, several cyclones swept over our country and caused immense harm to our people. Cyclone is a curse to the inhabitants of the coastal regions of Bangladesh. The tidal bore and the heavy showers wash away the stores of foodstuff and cause terrible damage. Drought causes serious harm to our crops and trees. Due to the want of water farmers cannot grow plants nor can produce bumper crops. As an aftermath, famine occurs. Many people die from hunger. However, we have to reduce the loss caused by various natural calamities. Using modern weather forecast, prior warning can be given to the people who are likely to be affected storm, cyclone etc. Moreover, the affected people and domestic livestock can be easily shifted to a safer place during flood and cyclone. Besides, a quick relief, medical treatment and essential medicines should be supplied among the affected people. Some effective measures should be taken by the govt. as well as different NGO‘s with a view to eliminating sufferings of the victims.</p>
