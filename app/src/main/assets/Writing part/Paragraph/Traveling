 <h3><center>Traveling</center></h3>
 
 <p>Traveling is something everyone would like to experience from a very young age. We are introduced to other countries first by watching television programs held to inform us of different cultures, languages, food and sights other places have. Visiting countries other than your own is extremely interesting. Some travel on business, others to go on holiday. Students also travel to study, to take a post graduate course in a well-known University. Others travel to educate themselves, to learn more about the country they are visiting, places of interest, like art and history museums, to experience their culture. Foreign travel contributes to a person’s education. People acquire information and increase their knowledge. They also learn a new language. If they do not travel they become insular. It is important to savour other nation’s culture, experience firsthand the way they live, cook and do things in everyday life. This fosters understanding and bridges the gap between nations. Foreign traveling can be made by the means many transports. But a journey by plane is the most fascinating of them. Everybody does not have the fortune to enjoy a airplane journey. I was one of the fortunate few. My first flight in the air was a very exciting experience in my life.I was traveling from Dhaka to Singapore by air. Entering the Shahjalal International Airport we had check-in using our passport. We entered the airplane in the morning. It was like getting into a car or bus but the noise of the machine made us feel that it was different. Soon the plane took off and rose in the air higher and higher. The buzzing sound which had fascinated me continued. When I looked down, things looked tiny. The plane rushed fast through the air without a bump or a jolt, when all of a sudden bad weather overtook us. The plane began to swing from side to side and the pilot was a little troubled in controlling it, but I felt happy like a bird swinging in the air. Due to weather, some of the passengers felt sick. Some slept in their seats but I sat still. I took great pleasure in looking at the scenery of the different places as we passed over. It was a lovely sight. It seemed to be a big dash through the air. Our plane finally touched down at Changi Airport, from where we drove off to a hotel in the heart of Singapore. The total flight had taken us nearly four hours. It was a very interesting and exciting journey indeed.</p>
