 <h3><center>Early marriage</center></h3>
 
 <p>Early marriage is a social malady in Bangladesh. Though at present it is stricity prohibited by the law of the country, it is still going on in different parts of the country. It is found that a girl of nine or ten is forced to marry a man of twenty or even thirty. In the petriarchal socio-economic set up a woman has no say in decision making. As a result, decision comes from the male member of the family who is the bread winner. Besides, in insolvent families parents usually think that to spend money for the education of a daughter is nothing but a wastage. Hence, they think of marrying their daughters off. Conservative outlook, religious orthodoxy, social prejudice are mostly responsible for early marriage. It is very rampant in our country that girls are the victims of gender discrimination. While a boy can hope to go to the college or univerity for higher education, a girl dare not finish his school. Besides, job opportunities for women are not sufficient in this country. Thus all these factors are responsible for early marriage. The girl who becomes the victim of early marriage gives birth to diseased child and she also suffers from different diseases, for example, anemia, malnutrition and birth complications. As it is a social curse, we all should stand against it Early Marriage.</p>
