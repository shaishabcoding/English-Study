 <p>Global love day is an annual celebration of humanity which is celebrated in countries and communities around the world each May 1. The Love Foundation, the nonprofit organization whose mission it is to “Inspire people to love unconditionally” presents the international event as a symbolic day of unconditional love. Global Love Day’s main theme, “Love begins with me,” has been the focus since its inception.
 The six tenets of Global Love Day are:
 We are one humanity on this planet.
 All life is interconnected and interdependent.
 All share in the Universal bond of love.
 Love begins with self acceptance and forgiveness.
 With respect and compassion we embrace diversity.
 Together we make a difference through love.</p>
