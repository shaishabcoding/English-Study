 <h3><center>A School library</center></h3>
 
 <p>A library is a store house of
 knowledge. A library satisfies our
 eternal desire for knowledge of the
 unknown and the unseen. A library
 plays an important role in the realm
 of knowledge. A library is a part and
 parcel of a school. No school is
 complete without a library. Our school
 has a big library. It is housed in a
 separate two storyed building. The
 library has a good collection. There
 are many almirahs. The books are
 arranged in different shelves
 according to subjects. The reading
 room and the office room of the
 librarian are separate. The librarian
 has some assistants. There is a big
 reading room. The reading room is
 well furnished. When we take the help
 of a catalogue, the assistants at once
 find the book and help us. We are
 issued library cards. We can borrow
 books from the library. We are to
 return the borrowed books after two
 weeks. In the reading room we can
 read as many books as we like. Silence
 is must here. Nobody is allowed to
 make noise. We are proud of our
 school library.</p>
