 <h3><center>Summer in Bangladesh</center></h3>
 
 <p>Bangladesh is a land of beauty. There are six seasons in our county. The seasons come here every two months. The summer is one of them. A summer morning is a bit moderate and tolerable. The sky remains clear and bright. People get up early in the morning from bed. But it becomes hotter and hotter as the sun goes up. The sun becomes scorching at noon. Then people do not dare go out and work for a long time. The farmers and laborers have to work under the scorching heat and dust. People gather in the shade of trees. Homemakers also get it very difficult to work in the kitchen. Students find it very difficult to work in class. In summer, most of the tanks and ponds dry up. Even the canals are without water. Villagers suffer from heat and scarcity of water. So the farmers can't irrigate their lands properly. As a result, food production is hampered. Summer is a season of fruits. Mangoes, jackfruits, blackberries, melons, and other fruits are available in summer. None can deny its usefulness.</p>
