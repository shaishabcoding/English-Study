 <p>Tree plantation is now the demand of time and context to make the world a suitable living place. To maintain the order of the environment, we need to plant more trees. When a proper and scientific method is followed to plant trees, it is called tree plantation. As an essential element of the environment, trees help us in many ways. It is not only the factory of oxygen but also inhales carbon dioxide, the most destructive factor for survival. The greatness and contribution of trees in our day-to-day life can little be described in words. They are our natural friends to survive and adorn our life. We cannot but depend on trees for our daily necessities. From shelter to medicines, we have to rely on it. We can't but depend on trees for building our houses and making furniture. Trees are the primary source of our fuel force. In addition, they provide us with fruits that meet our demand for vitamins and minerals. Giving shed, they protect us from the ultraviolet ray of the sun. Indeed they save the earth from becoming desert, maintaining ecological balance. Anyone can easily imagine what terrible matter will happen if no trees exist. Without trees, the world will turn into lifeless bare ground. The most shocking point is that we randomly cut down these tested friends for our better and more comfortable living. But now it is time to consider filling the gap created by cutting down trees. So, planting more trees must be our only vision and mission. Mainly July and August are the two effective months for planting trees. Due to the rainy season during this time, we do not need to think of watering and extra care. Generally, in an open place, trees can be planted. Notably, roadside, mountain slopes, homesteads, and educational institutions are the perfect places for planting trees. Above all, it is foregone that our life on this earth will be endangered without trees. So, by raising public awareness and field campaigns, the government and the mass people must be kind and strict in planting trees.
