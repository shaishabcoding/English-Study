 <h3><center>Global Village</center></h3>
 
 <p>The term ‘global village’ was first used by Marshal McLuhan. In 1962 and 1964 he wrote two books on media and communication. In his books, he said that telephone, TV and electronic media have brought all mankind close to one another. For example, if we see the news of floods in a distant country on TV, we feel that we are also connected there. We can see that is happening at the same moment. We can share the same suffering with the people who are in real misery at the moment. McLuhan believed that electronic media would make the world a global village. When he first said about the idea of the global village, the Internet was not invented. But now, personal computers and the Internet have made McLuhan’s idea more correct than ever. Now the entire globe is chained in the world-wide-web called 'The Internet'.</p>
