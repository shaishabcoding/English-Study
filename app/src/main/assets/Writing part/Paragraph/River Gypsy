 <h3><center>River Gypsy</center></h3>
 
 <p>Many ethnic groups live in Bangladesh. River gypsies are a part of an ethnic group in our country. They are used to living in the water. Generally, they are known as 'bodies' to the local people; They have their lifestyle and culture. They live in groups and have no land. They travel from one place to another and live in different areas. They roam across our rivers and waters from May to December with small boats. Boats are their houses. When the river's water dries, they go to their mainland and live there. During the monsoon, they remain busy fishing. They collect natural pearls from the water. Men catch snakes and entertain people with snake charming and sell herbal cures. Women sell bangles, cosmetics, and other things. They have some problems. First, Bangladesh is being urbanized very rapidly. They are losing their customers in the urban population. Many of them are changing their lifestyle with time.</p>
