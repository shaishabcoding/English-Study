 <h3><center>Water Pollution</center></h3>
 
 <p>No animal or plant can live without water. The other name of water is life. In the same way, we can say that another name for water is death. Pure water saves a life, while impure water kills them. Water pollution means impuring water, which is getting impure in many ways through which water becomes poisonous. People pollute water in many ways. They frequently throw garbage into the water. Toxic chemicals from factories are drained off into rivers and canals. Fertilizers, pesticides, and insecticides used in cultivation mix with water, and thus water gets seriously polluted. The outcome of water pollution is suffering from deadly diseases like diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid, cholera, etc. Water-borne diseases are no less fatal than air-borne diseases. Diarrhea and cholera may spread in the shape of epidemics and cause a heavy toll of death as they had previously caused. Villages after village were used to turning into crematoriums. If left untreated. Diarrhea and dysentery may take chronic form and, at a stage, become medicine-resistant. It is a matter of great regret that some people still use unhygienic toilets, drink surface water 'without boiling, take baths and wash clothes and utensils in the same pond or canal where the dirty toilets are. Water contamination is sometimes beyond treatment. So we should be careful about it. We must be aware of pollution. We should drink pure water. We can easily collect rainwater for drinking since it is solely pollution-free. Utensils should be washed with sterile, preferably boiled water. The authority concerned should build and run new water treatment plants and set more tubewells.
