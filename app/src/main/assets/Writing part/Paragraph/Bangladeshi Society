 <h3><center>Bangladeshi Society</center></h3>
 
 <p>
 Bangladesh did not exist as a distinct geographic and ethnic unity until independence. The region had been a part of successive Indian empires, and during the British period it formed the eastern part of a hinterland of Bengal, which was dominated by the British rulers and hindu professional, commercial, and landed elites. After the estab lishment of Pakistanin 1947, present-day Bangladesh came under the hege mony of the non-Bengali Muslimelites of the West Wing of Pakistan. The establishment of Bangladesh, therefore, implied the formation of both a new nation and a new social order.</p>
