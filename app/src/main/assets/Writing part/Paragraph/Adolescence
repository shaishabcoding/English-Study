 <p>Adolescence is a changing stage of physical and physiological development that happens during the period between childhood and adulthood.
 
 This is an important part of life. This is a really critical period of life. In adolescence, girls and boys float in a very vibrant and fantasy world. Thus everything looks vibrant to them. That is why they will go wide. Adolescence may be a time of risk.
 
 Unlimited freedom brings disasters for them. They rush to the path of destruction without knowing the consequence.
 
 An adolescent may be a youth who is developing from a child to an adult. They may be addicted to alcohol, cigarettes and alternative drugs that may cause deadly diseases.
