 <h3><center>Bangabandhu Satellite</center></h3>
 
 <p>A satellite is an artificial object which has
 been intentionally placed into orbit .
 The Bangabandhu Satellite-1 is the first
 Bangladeshi geostationary
 communications and Broadcasting Satellite
 . It was manufactured by Thales Alenia
 Space and launched on 11 May 2018.
 Bangladesh Government formed a
 Government-owned Bangladesh
 Communication Satellite Company Limited,
 BCSCL with the aim to operate the
 Bangabandhu Satellite-1. The launch made
 Bangladesh the 57th nation in the world
 and fourth in South Asia after India,
 Pakistan and Sri Lanka to own a satellite.
 Bangabandhu-1 satellite carries a total of
 40 transponders (26 KU-band and 14 C-
 band transponders) with a capacity of
 1600 MHz. In the outer section of the
 satellite the red-green flag of Bangladesh
 is painted and on the flag, there is written
 “Bangabandhu-1” in English and Bangla.
 There is also a monogram of the
 government of Bangladesh. The
 Bangabandhu-1 satellite weighs 3,500. In
 BS-1 The priority satellite applications are
 (1) Direct to Home (DTH) (2) VSAT (3)
 Backhaul and Trucking (4) Network
 Restoration (5) Disaster Preparedness and
 relief. For these sectors, Bangladesh was
 depended on foreign satellites. Which
 costs us around 14M per year. This Huge
 cost will be avoided and moreover, by
 renting some frequency broadband, we will
 earn a sufficient amount. The Primary
 Service Area (PSA): Once launched,
 Bangabandhu-1 will save this annual cost,
 and bring in foreign currency by leasing
 out half its capacity to SAARC nations, as
 well as countries like Indonesia, the
 Philippines, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and
 Tajikistan if the frequencies are properly
 coordinated. The telecom regulator hopes
 to break even in seven years. The satellite
 will narrow the digital divide, as it will help
 take broadcast and telecom services to
 rural areas and allow the launch of some
 lucrative ventures like direct-to-home
 services throughout the country.
 Bangabandhu Satellite1’s mission is
 expected to last at least 15 years.</p>
