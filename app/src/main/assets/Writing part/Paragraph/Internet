 <h3><center>Internet</center></h3>
 
 <p>A window of multidimensional communication In the modern global world Internet is the easiest and cheapest way of communication. It is a new device for speedy transmission of notion, information, news, feelings etc. in the process of computer networks. De facto, Internet is the network of all Intranets and networks in the world. To have an Internet connection we need a speedy computer, modem, telephone line and the help of an ISP (Internet Service Provider). The ISP maintains all accounts of Internet users. When a user sends messages from his computer, the modem processes them and sends them to the ISP and finally the server of the ISP sends them to the destination. Nowadays this type of Internet connection is going to be obsolete because the new broadband Internet connection is providing the users with the advantages of Internet access without telephone wires. It is done with the help of an antenna and some other required devices. Moreover, the broadband Internet connection can provide the users with all types of modern communication facilities at the cheapest rate. Our T & T Board has already introduced VSAT in our country by which the users can have a connection without telephone line through wires. As a result, cellular telephone or mobile phone is being used in our country. Now cellular phone provides the advantages of Internet connection. However, through Internet we can access any information-zone of the world having only a click on the computer's mouse. We can exchange our views and ideas with others and simultaneously can have an Internet chat with the help of IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and with many other popular programmes. In modern transaction Internet is providing us with the facilities of Ready-Cash, MasterCard, Visa-Card and what not. Now text as well as image is possible to be sent simultaneously through Internet. Besides these, through Internet the users can get advantages of voicemail, email, telephone, web-phone, fax, telex, and video.</p>
