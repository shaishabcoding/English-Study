 <h3><center>Padma Bridge</center></h3>
 
 <p>One of the dream projects of Bangladesh is Padma Bridge. It will be the world’s sixth-largest multipurpose bridge. From December 2014 the bridge has started its construction journey and still going great guns. Although, it wasn’t easy at the start considering funds and other economic issues. Even, the World Bank canceled its credit agreement. At last, the country had come up with its own fund.
 
 But for the country, economic issue was not the only thing to deal with. Because river Padma has two natures – calm in winter and cruel in summer. So, Engineers divided the construction process into five parts to solve this problem. The first of them was constructing the main bridge. that’s 6.15km in length. This phase includes setting up 41 spans and the erection of 42 supports for connecting both banks. River training is the second part. Probably the most difficult part of the process. The third and fourth part is connecting links which are to connect the bridge with two highways. One will be made in Janjira and another in Mawa. Service area construction for servicing is the fifth step. The last of them is the supervision of the whole project. Padma bridge will connect the south-west region of the country with the capital and eastern part. For this, regional cooperation will increase and transport management will be convenient. In addition, it will play an important role in the economic sector of Bangladesh. Industrial development and employment opportunities will cause radical changes in the condition of south-west residents.
 
 Not only economy and transportation facilities will increase but also medical and educational facilities will be easy to access. The whole country waits for its largest bridge to activate. It has been said that Padma Bridge will be inaugurated in December 2022. The world will be witnessing the history of proud Bangladesh.</p>
