 <p>Facebook is a social networking website intended to connect friends, family, and business associates. It is the largest of the networking sites, with the runner up being My Space. It began as a college networking website and has expanded to include anyone and everyone. Facebook was founded by 2004 by Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg and originally called the Facebook. It was quickly successful on campus and expanded beyond Harvard into other Ivy League schools. At that time, it was only available to schools, universities, organizations, and companies within English speaking countries, but has since expanded to include anyone. Facebook users create a profile page that shows their friends and networks information about themselves. The choice to include a profile in a network means that everyone within that network can view the profile. The profile typically includes the following: Information, Status, Friends, and Friends in Other Networks, Photos, Notes, Groups, and The Wall. Users are able to search for friends and acquaintances by e-mail address, school, university, or just by typing in a name or location for search. When people become friends, they are able to see all of each others' profiles including contact information. E-mail notifications let users know when new friends have chosen to add them to their list or when someone has sent a message to them within the system. A popular feature on Facebook is the ability to share photographs uploaded from a phone, camera, or hard drive. As with other private information, users have the option to allow only friends to see their pictures or anyone. There is an unlimited amount of storage available, which is a major advantage of Facebook’s photograph sharing capabilities.</p>
