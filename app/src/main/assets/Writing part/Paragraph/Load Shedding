 <h3><center>Load Shedding</center></h3>
 
 <p>Load shedding has become a very common affair in our daily life these days. The people living in the areas supplied with electricity are quite familiar with the term load shedding. In the modern world electricity plays a very important role in regulating our life. Any interruption in the supply of this vital item of energy can put the whole system out of order and simultaneously can paralyze our daily activities. In our country there is hardly any area which is not affected by load shedding. Load shedding means the discontinuation of supply of electricity. Load shedding occurs when generation of power is less than the demand and when we distribute electricity wrongly. It creates many problems of far-reaching consequences in the economic and social development of the country. Most of the mills and factories become idle and for this reason industrial production declines and workers are retrenched. Social works and activities cannot go in order. Students cannot study properly because of the failure of electricity. During load shedding they are to study in dim candlelight. The housewife gropes in the darkness in the kitchen. The shops are to close down before the closing time. Spectators in the cinema hall spend hours in stuffy suffocation for load shedding. All types of productions stop and the entire life comes to a standstill during the period of load shedding. So, proper steps should be taken to stop load shedding. By establishing more power plants, power houses and by stopping unplanned distribution of electricity, illegal connection and reducing system loss, we can solve this problem.</p>
