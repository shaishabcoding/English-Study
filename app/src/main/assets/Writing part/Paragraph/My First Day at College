 <h3><center>My First Day at College</center></h3>
 
 <p>A memorable event In my life, some happenings have remained vivid in my memory. My first day at college is one of them and it has occupied an abiding place in the core of my heart. It was August 05, 1991. That day I had my bath and breakfast earlier. I put on my new cloths and went out for the college at 9 AM, with my parents‘ blessings. When the college building came into my view, my heart leapt up with pleasure. The large building, though I saw it before, appeared new to me. I felt freer, experienced boundless joy and thought myself in a new world. I went to the notice board and took down the routine. The bell rang. It was 10 AM. According to the routine, I entered a room numbered four. After a few moments, a gentleman entered. We all stood up and honoured him. He was the professor of English. When we sat down, he called over the rolls. His speech was mainly on our responsibility as college students. Then I attended Bangla and Computer classes. In the interval, I with one of my new classmates walked round the different blocks of the college building. I went to the student‘s common room. I noticed many differences between my school and college. In my school, all classes held in a row but in college there are intervals between classes. Moreover, teachers in college are very experienced. In my college, there are a huge library and a large common room, which are different from my school ones. I liked the teachers and the library most. I left the college. I returned home with a happy heart, a broad outlook and rich insight and experience.</p>
