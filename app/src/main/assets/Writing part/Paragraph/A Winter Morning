 <h3><center>A
 Winter Morning</center></h3>
 
 <p>There are six seasons in our
 country. Winter is one of them. It is the
 season of mist and cold. So, a winter
 morning is misty and cold. There is
 dense fog everywhere. Everything looks
 hazy. Things at a distance can hardly be
 seen. The tall trees are covered with fog
 and they cannot be made out. It dews at
 night. When the morning sun peeps the
 dew-drops look like glittering diamond on
 grass and plants, in this season, the poor
 people suffer a lot because they do not
 have warm clothes to put on. The
 condition of birds and animal’s beggar’s
 description. They feel happy to see the
 rays of the sun. Sweet date juice is
 available in this season. People like to
 drink the juice. The scene of the winter
 morning gradually changes as the day
 advances. The sun goes up and fog
 disappears. Then people go to their
 respective works.</p>
