 <h3><center>Bangladesh police</center></h3>
 
 <p>The Bangladesh Police is the main law enforcement agency of Bangladesh. It is administered under the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Government of Bangladesh. It plays a crucial role in maintaining peace, and enforcement of law and order within Bangladesh. Though the police are primarily concerned with the maintenance of law and order and security of persons and property of individuals, it also plays a big role in the criminal justice system.
 After decades of misuse and neglect, Bangladesh police is a source of instability and fear rather than a key component of a democratic society. A friend asks another friend "How many people were there at the tea shop?" He replies, "Oh, only a few, just a couple of gentle men and a cop." You must have heard this joke or one of its many variations. The implied hint is clear. There are obvious reasons behind this common perception. But like all generalizations, these do not portray the whole truth.
 
 Police is one of the important law enforcing agencies to control the pace of crime and law and order situation. Subordinate Police Officers are the key role players in this context. At present, crime is increasing; the criminal justice system is cracking under heavy workload; society’s expectations from the police are high but the police’s status and resources, working and living conditions leave a lot to be desired. Moreover, the law enforcers are encountering some humanitarian issues and limited facilities.</p>
