 <p>Sidor is name of a natural disaster that hit our country on the 15th November 2007. Strong winds had started on the coastal zones since the 14th afternoon. Some parts of the country were affected by it. Barisal, Bhola, Patuakhali, Barguna, Pirojpur, Jalakathi, Bagerhat, Khulna, Satkhira and Jessore were the worst affected areas of the country. The after effect was unimaginable. Sidor took away the valuable lives of above 3000 people. The cyclone snatched away the children from the lap of their mother. It demolished houses, crops, vegetables and trees. It destroyed the richest forest of our country. People were suffering for want of food, water, and shelter. Government should take necessary steps to build cyclone shelter and raise public awareness to face this kind of natural disaster.</p>
