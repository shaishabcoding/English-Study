 <h3><center>A Street Accident</center></h3>
 
 <p>A street accident is a regular phenomenon in the highways and cities of our country. Every year it kills hundreds of lives. The indirect effect of this invisible monster is the downfall and untold suffering of hundreds of thousands of other people who are family members of those victims.A number of factors are responsible for this mishap including the inattentiveness of drivers, the working of a driver over too long a tome at a stretch, the bad conditions of the streets, and most importantly, the maudlin competitiveness of the drivers. In Bangladesh, every day we find the news of road accident in our daily newspapers and the screen of television. It really makes us very shocked. Last month I faced such type of pathetic road accident. It occurred in Mirpur road near Kolabagan bus stand. When I was standing on the rod and waiting for the bus. Then I saw a little boy who was trying to cross the busy road. When he was crossing the road at that time a bus was coming towards him with a great speed. But within a short time, it ran over the body of the boy and at once the boy was seriously injured. After sometimes when he was taken to the hospital, the doctor declared him as death. Really, it made me more pathetic and I cannot forget it easily.</p>
