 <h3><center>A Railway Station</center></h3>
 
 <p>A terminal for passengers A railway platform/station is the place where trains stop at and depart from. The passengers get on and get off a train from a railway station/platform. It usually occupies a large area. A railway station has a platform. However a big railway station has a number of platforms. Platforms are often covered with huge tin-shed. If there are more than one platform, an over-bridge connects them. In a railway station/platform there are some rooms too, namely station master‘s room, waiting room, restaurant, go-down, booking office, ticket counter. There are some benches in the railway station/platform for the convenience of the travelling passengers. One can also see some stalls in a row selling cheaper kinds of books, newspapers, magazines etc. snacks and tea and even stationary goods. Besides, a large number of hawkers can be seen busily moving from passengers to passengers with cigarettes, betel leaf, bread, chanachur etc. We find some beggars, thieves, swindlers and pickpockets in that place too. A railway platform/ station becomes very busy when a train arrives. Whistles of the train, rustling sound of the engine, movements of the passengers in a hurry, shouts of the hawkers and porters make the railway station/platform full of din and bustle. When the train whistles away, the station becomes calm and quiet. All these pictures taken together remind us of the famous line of the poet, ―Man may come and man may go, I go on forever. This coming and going sustain the flow of life. Of course, a railway station/platform is a very busy and important place.</p>
