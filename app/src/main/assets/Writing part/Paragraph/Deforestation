 Generally cutting down trees extensively to fulfill the basic needs of fuel and housing and thus destroying the ecological balance is called deforestation. It’s natural that human being needs houses, furniture, firewood etc. For this, man uses wood. Wood is also used in big industries. Man makes shops, educational institution, boats, launches, trucks and other vehicles that lead many people to cut down trees. It causes threats to our environment. There are also many people engaged in cutting down trees from the forests making vast areas almost bare and leaving many wild animals in danger.All these have multifarious effects on the environment. Floods and droughts, cyclones and tornadoes are the common phenomena in a region or in a country where deforestation is going on. In our country less rainfall, excessive rainfall, bad harvest, soil erosion, extinction of wild animals, greenhouse effects are the problems prevailing due to deforestation. To prevent deforestation some pragmatic steps should be taken. A social movement should be launched to prevent deforestation. Social awareness can be raised regarding bad effects of deforestation. For this purpose, environment of science and study on ecology should be introduced from school level. Massive awareness regarding tree plantation can be raised through TV programmes. And above all, our forest department should enforce all codes of manner strictly at least to reduce deforestation. Besides them our government should apply hard rules to make the consciousness of the common people and we have to be conscious for saving our woods.</p>
