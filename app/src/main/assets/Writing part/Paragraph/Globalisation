 <h3><center>Globalisation</center></h3>
 
 <p>A new notion of global interaction Globalisation means internationalisation. It is a phenomenon involving the integration of economics, cultures, governmental policies, and the movements around the world. Trade and investment between countries have promoted interdependence and the world‘s economies for centuries. What is now called globalisation, however, represents an exponential acceleration of the integration process. It has been formed by the leading countries of the world. Nowadays the world is linked as never before due to advances in communication and transportation and also due to trade agreements that have lowered or eliminated barriers or borders in the exchange of goods. So our world has become a global village. As a result, similar goods are sold around the world for similar prices. The highly integrated financial and commodity markets see price movements in one part of the world instantaneously reflected in other major markets. The BBC, CNN, MTV and the Internet have accelerated the integration of global culture. Science and technology have also accelerated this global process. So, teenagers around the world watch the same videos, listen to the same music and wear the same clothes. However, we can say that globalisation may bring happiness for us all only if we can make a mutual understanding, otherwise it will not only become a threat to a developing nation but also ruin our existence and may turn us into parasites.</p>
