 <h3><center>A rainy day</center></h3>
 
 <p>A rainy day is a day when it rains continuously all day long during the rainy season. It is called a pouring day. The sky is overcast with thick of black clouds and the sun remains hidden behind them. The weather is foul. The sun is not seen. Sometimes, gusty wind blows with rain. Rivers, canals and tanks swell up. Roads and paths get muddy and slippery. Water stands here and there. Normal life is disrupted due to heavy rain. One does not generally come out without compulsion. The common people cannot attend their respective places in time. If anybody wants to go outside, he has to take an umbrella with him. The poor and the day laborers do not like a rainy day. They cannot go out to earn their living. Their suffering knows no bounds. They go on starving. A rainy day is most welcomed to the students, as they have no classes in the school. A rainy day brings joyous mood to the young boys of the same age and they are seen to bathe in rainwater with merriment. People pass the boy in listening to music, watching TV, reading novels. Those who have imaginary bent of mind enjoy the beauty of nature being drenched in rains. The cloudy sky lets loose their emotions. A rainy day has good effect on the soil. It helps plants to grow, flowers to bloom and nature looks fresh and beautiful. However, a rainy day is not pleasant to all.</p>
