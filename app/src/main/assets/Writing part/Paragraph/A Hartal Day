 <h3><center>A Hartal Day</center></h3>
 
 <p>A suspension of regular activities In modern civilisation most of the states of the world face hartal in season and out of season. So we are quite familiar with it. Hartal is the rightful demand of the political parties. It is observed at the call of a political party or parties to press their demand to the ruling party. Sometimes the opposition political party or parties call hartal against the corruption, misgovernment, misuse of power and the evil deeds of the ruling party. At times students and people of a locality call hartal to expose their demand. On a hartal day the usual course of life is hampered. The communication system of the country is broken down as all vehicles and the other transports cannot move. Rickshaws are seen few and far between. Picketers burn cars and others on the road to stop the movement of the vehicles. People are to face a lot of troubles on a hartal day. They go on foot. The road looks desolate. The economical activities of the country come to a stand still. Most of the mills and factories, markets and shops remain closed. The foreign investors lose their interest to the country. Often clashes occur between the police and picketers or between the hartal activists and the anti-hartal activists. Sometimes these clashes bring loss of lives. The police are engaged in important spots to control the situation and to avert unwanted events. Yet harassment of man and women often becomes a common scene. On a hartal day students suffer a lot. We hope the peaceful solution of any problem arisen between the government and the opposition. Above all, we should consider the suffering of the people while calling hartal. We also ought to consider that the would-be hartal is so necessary? So we should abstain ourselves from calling hartal as far as possible.</p>
