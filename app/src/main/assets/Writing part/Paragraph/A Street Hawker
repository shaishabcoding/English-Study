 <h3><center>A Street Hawker</center></h3>
 
 <p>The man who hawks many things on the road, near bus stand, railway station, bazaar etc. is called a street hawker. Generally a street hawker deals in various things. He carries his materials on head and sometimes in hand and sometimes in a small handicraft. He generally buys his goods at a cheaper rate and sells them at a good profit. A street hawker has some extra techniques to convince his customers because he is very cunning and he knows his business very well.Mostly, it is seen that his customers are children and women. Generally, he brings toys, sweets and other things for children and sells them at a good rate. He also brings bangles, ribbons, clothing’s, fruits, fancy goods and things of domestic uses for women. He speaks in different ways to draw the attention of his customers. A hawker also knows the time/hour of his business. He does not come when the housemasters are at home. Rather he comes when the housemasters are out of home and when the women are free from their household work and duties. Normally, the life of a hawker is not so easy. He has to work hard to manage his livelihood. Though he works hard, his income is very poor. So, he lives under the poverty line.</p>
