 <p>A school is a place where children are educated. It is the place of learning knowledge and building character. I also continue my formal study at a renowned local school. The name of our school is green view high school. It is in b. Baria Sadar thana. It is situated beside the Sylhet-Chittagong railway. The school was established in the year 1968. It is one of the best schools in the district. This is a vast school. The school is housed in a one-storeyed and l-shaped building. There are twenty rooms in all. There is the headmaster's room, the teachers' room, the girls' shared room, a library, and a science laboratory. There is a vast field in front of our school. There are twenty-one teachers in our school. They are sympathetic and helpful to us. They teach us with great care. Most of the teachers are highly educated and trained. Our headmaster is an m., A.
