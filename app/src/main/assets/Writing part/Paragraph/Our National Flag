 <h3><center>Our National Flag</center></h3>
 
 <p>The national flag is the symbol of a nation. Every independent country has a separate national flag. As an independent nation, we have our national flag. The size of our national flag may be big or small. It differs according to the places where it is to be hoisted. To make the flag, we are to follow a specific rule. The ratio of length and breadth is 5 : 3—the radius of the red circle is one-fifth of the size of the national flag. A giant flag is used for buildings; on the other hand, a small flag is used for a car. However, a specification has to be maintained in making a flag. Our national flag is Prussian green with a red sun in the middle. There are separate meanings for each of the colors. The green color stands for the ever-freshness of our nation, and the red color bears the memory of the bloody struggle of our country. It also stands for the glory and pride that our country has. Our national flag is our glory and is very dear to us. So its dignity to us, the people of Bangladesh, is vast. We should do our best to uphold its dignity as our freedom fighters laid down their lives to free the country from the brutal Pakistani army. We can do it by considering the nation's interest before our own. Thus, our freedom fighters' noble and supreme sacrifice will be honored. Our national flag is our glory and pride. We will not be able to live with dignity and honor if we fail to uphold its dignity. Every citizen of our country should take an oath that we will keep the benefit of our national flag at the cost of our lives. May God give us such power.</p>
