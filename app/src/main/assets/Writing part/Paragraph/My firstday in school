 <h3><center>My firstday in school</center></h3>
 
 <p>There are many beautiful memories in human life. While some memories are forgotten, some other memories are so important and the heart touches that which is not forgotten and remain fresh ever. The memory of my first day at school is still fresh in my heart.
 
 I was 6 years old then. My father told me I was going to start my first school life. I was feeling very excited and nervous then. I couldn’t think of anything else then. I could not sleep that night because I was thinking about school, teachers, students all the time. The next morning my mother woke me up early. I took a bath. My mother put on a nice dress. After breakfast, we started walking to school. About 20 minutes later we arrived at school. My school name is ___________________. I saw a lot of students playing in the school. Some are talking to each other. But everyone is unfamiliar to me. Mother took me to the headmaster’s room. He asked me some questions and I answered all the questions. He was very pleased with my answer. Then he called a teacher and took me to my class. I was enrolled in class one. The class teacher and students accepted me with heartily. At first I was nervous, but later on I became normal. I will remember this day till the last day of my life.</p>
